app folder contains executable app.jar which transforms insert pl sql statements generated by plsql into try insert catch update block

you can pass primary key as first argument to the executable to specify primary key
    otherwise first column will be used as primary key

example usage:
    put file my_file.sql into app/input/my_file.sql
    java -jar app.jar
    generated file is printed to the console as well as new file is put into
        app/output/my_file.sql

example with primary key not as first column:
    put file my_file.sql into app/input/my_file.sql
    java -jar app.jar <PK_COLUMN_NAME_CASE_SENSITIVE>
    generated file is printed to the console as well as new file is put into
            app/output/my_file.sql
